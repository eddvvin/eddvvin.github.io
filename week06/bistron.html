<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
  <p>This week I am <em>extremely excited</em> about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>
  <p>Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide Salmon</em> with <em>Dill Hollandaise</em>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us <b>before</b> November 30.</p>
